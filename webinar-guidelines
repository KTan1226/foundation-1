LFPH Webinar Guidelines

Overview
  LFPH webinars are hosted by maintainers, members, and staff and provide an opportunity to share their progress with the LFPH community. Webinars are hosted on Zoom and the recordings are posted to the LFPH YouTube channel.
  Please note: We are unable to share leads due to the Linux Foundation privacy policy.

Webinar day and time
  English language webinars are scheduled once a month at 11:00 AM PT. 
  
Please read the guidelines carefully
  We have outlined content guidelines and timelines. Webinars that do not meet the requirements will be cancelled.
  You must provide your webinar details no later than 4 weeks before the webinar date. At least 2 weeks prior to the webinar date you must provide your complete and final slides.
  If the webinar is cancelled due to not meeting these guidelines, the member will not be allowed to schedule a webinar in the subsequent webinar period. That is, premier and general members may not schedule a webinar in the upcoming quarter and silver members may not schedule a webinar in the upcoming 6 months.

Who can host a webinar
  Premier members can host 1 webinar a quarter
  General members can host 2 webinars a year.
  Public health authority associate members and Academic or nonprofit associate members can host 1 webinar a year.
  LFPH maintainers can host 2 webinars a year.
  LFPH staff will host webinars on an as-needed basis.
  
Webinar content guidelines
  The simplest guideline is that webinar topics should be comparable to what would be accepted in an Open Source Summit + Embedded Linux Conference.
  No straight product pitches. It is okay to do a comparison of part of the landscape, but webinars should not be promotional.
  Any platforms, tools, or technologies you are describing must be open source and work with LFPH. 
  
Members can add a slide at the end of their webinar on where to get more information. Examples:
  Share contact info of speaker - Twitter, Slack, email
  Links to company websites
  Links to projects websites or Github
  Can advertise if they are hiring and who to contact if interested

Note: This is not a link to the LFPH website.

LFPH will review the statement, as we do for the content for the webinar, to approve the content. If changes are needed, we will provide suggested changes.

Webinar Calendar
  Webinar hosts are welcome to submit their webinar ideas by emailing webinars@lfph.io.
Webinar Checklist
  4 weeks before the webinar date: Provide your webinar information including the webinar abstract and speaker information via the Google Form.
  2 weeks before the webinar date: Share your final webinar slides via the Google Form.

Please be aware of these timelines. We recommend you create a reminder to provide us this information by the due date. If we do not receive the information from you within the timelines outlined, your webinar will be cancelled.
If you cannot provide your content via a Google Form (for example, our colleagues in China), please email your webinar materials to webinars@lfph.io.

Webinar Promotion & Prep Details
  Upon receipt of the abstract and the webinar being set up in Zoom, the hosting company will receive a link to the webinar registration page. The hosting company should use that link to promote the webinar.
  The webinar is added to the LFPH webinar page.
  LFPH may promote the webinar via email and Twitter.
  Our most successful webinars are when the presenting company helps promote in addition to LFPH promotion. We are often able to double our attendance in these cases.

Webinar: Presentations
  2 weeks prior to your webinar, send your final webinar presentation to webinars@lfph.io. All presentations must be reviewed prior to the webinar.
  NOTE: presentations not received 2 weeks before the webinar date will result in the webinar being cancelled.
  
Helpful Notes on Presentation Design
  Obsolete, low-res (i.e., pixelated), and malformatted logos are an epidemic among conference presentations.
 
Webinar Moderator
  LFPH will provide a moderator for the webinar. The moderator is an LFPH staff member.
  The moderator is responsible for covering the housekeeping items and helping the presenter manage the Q&A.
  
Webinar: Day-Of Details
  Webinar Prep: Â½ hour before the webinar starts. Soundcheck, webinar slides, moderation of the Q&A.
  Live Webinar: Starts at the top of the hour
  Typical timing of the webinar - approximately 5 minute introduction, 45 minute presentation, 10 minutes of Q&A
  LFPH staff will help moderate (introduction, feeding questions to the presenter)
  
Webinar Platform: Zoom
  After the webinar, registration numbers and a link to the webinar on YouTube will be shared with the company hosting the webinar. LFPH does not provide a copy of the webinar recording for individual company use.
  Please note: We are unable to share the list of leads or include any promotions with the intention of driving leads.
